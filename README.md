# Francesca Chater

I am a Junior Developer looking for my first job to learn all sorts of exciting new things. If my masters degree taught me anything, it was to  write clearly, you want people on your side. This translates across all walks of life, especially when writing code. 

The most fun thing I have taken from Makers Academy is that if I can learn one thing, I can learn another.

# E D U C A T I O N

#### Makers Academy (April '19 to July '19)

- Building new things every week.
- Fast, independent learner. Learnt 
- Great collaborator [PROVIDE EVIDENCE]

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP. During my first engineering project I worked in a team of 6 to create a website called Spacebook. To ensure an agile working environment we met as a team three times a day for check-ins, documenting what we had acheived and what we were going to do for the next section of the day. We estimated how long each task would take and created two-day sprints to accomdate this. 
- I am language agnostic. Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine


- Pair programming (Driver / Navigator)
- Test Driven Development with RSpec 

#### University of Sussex (Sep '10 to May '14)

- **Human Rights MA (Merit)**
- I focussed on women in the UK prison system and interviewed staff across the job board. Though I wasn't able to come to any real conclusions in my dissertation, hearing about experiences from the interviewees was one of the best things I did at university.

- **English Literature and History of Art BA (Hons) 2:1**
- I learnt how not to write. I could waffle, bluff and throw out vague, embellished sentences full of words I didn't understand. A crucial lesson for all areas of life: say what you want to say as simply as possible, you want the reader on your side. This emphasised the importance of clean code in my programmes. You don't want to stress people out when they look at your files.
