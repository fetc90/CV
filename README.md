# Francesca Chater

I come from a PR and marketing background. I love writing so hugely enjoyed that aspect of my work but the marketing route wasn’t for me. I had worked for two apps and the developers were my favourite people, they knew what could or couldn’t be done and how to build it. One of the tasks in my previous job was to write the weekly newsletter. I was given a HTML template to play with in Dreamweaver which quickly became my favourite part of the job. So I took the plunge, quit my job, and did an intensive coding course at Makers. 

During my time at Makers, and since, I have hugely enjoyed problem-solving as it has made me more creative than I can remember. Instead of believing something can’t be done, it’s hugely fun to find what can be done and incorporate those solutions to a project.   

## Projects


**Personal Projects**<br>
After graduating, I was keen to use Unity and C# to build an AR app. I made a Fireworks simulation in Unity to see how C# interacted with 3D objects and an AR palm tree app in Vuforia.

[Palm Tree Github](https://github.com/fetc90/palm-tree) <br>

I am currently working through the online Tyler McGinnis course to “master the JavaScript Ecosystem”, to build my first app in React.

For the final project at Makers, our team built a plant health monitoring system in ten days. We used new software and hardware, taking readings from the moisture in the soil via a sensor, and showcasing the data on a real-time graph on a touchscreen attached to a raspberry pi.

Finally, an app for aliens to communicate with their friends.

We deployed Spacebook automatically to Heroku with Travis CI. Setting it up was one of the most challenging parts of the project; all our tests were passing on Travis but the build wasn't deploying. I discovered that there are two different Travis platforms, travis.com and travis.org. As there are two, it matters how you create an encrypted authentication token which was causing the issue.

#### University of Sussex (Sep '10 to May '14)


Human Rights MA *(Merit)*

I based my dissertation on women in prisons in the UK. I interviewed prison staff across the board, including male and female officers, a counsellor from the sexual offenders ward, a nurse and the prison warden. The research was engrossing and the experience was the most rewarding I had at university. Because of this, one day I would like to volunteer as a teacher in prisons, teaching either creative writing or computer programming. 
 
English Literature and Art History BA *(2:1)*

During my BA, I learnt the invaluable lesson of how not to write. I loved reading novels and studying emotive (and some not so emotive) pieces of art, at the same time I was reading a lot of critical essays on literature and art – and unfortunately I started imitating those essays in my own writing. It was not effective. What point was I trying to make? Who knows, you've fallen down my Alice-in-Wonderland-tunnel of a sentence. You want the readers on your side. You also want to know exactly what you're talking about. Sure, obvious now, but it takes a couple of years of waffle to fully comprehend how little sense you’re making. 



## Experience

I come from a PR and marketing background with experience in managing brand and publicity campaigns. There was lots of pitching to press, copywriting, photo editing, using CRM databases, building Facebook ads and writing reports from Google Analytics. 

My favourite part of my previous job was writing the weekly newsletter about running which was sent out to an audience of 100,000. I greatly enjoyed the challenge of trying to find quirky or original stories about running - or if I couldn't find any - write about them in a way that I found amusing.

**tpr Media Consultants** (August '15 to April '17)   
*Account Manager*  

A PR company that promoted mainly documentaries, e.g. *The Killing Fields of Sri Lanka* or *Last Whites of the East End* (we tended to promote things with a social angle), but then expanded to help promote causes, such as *Justice for Health*: the Junior Doctors who took Jeremy Hunt to court proteseting unsafe working contracts. 

I pitched to press across all the boards - newspaper, radio, television - and helped write press campaigns from start to finish.

I also quickly became the token 'IT guy' of the office.

**YPlan** (October '14 to June '15)   
*Content Producer*

This was my first expereince working with software developers. My role was to write content and edit images that would engage the users. Every week, there was a meeting with all the staff members about what could be done to improve the app and I could listen to the developers talk about what they had acheived. Unbeknownst to me, my experience at YPlan planted the seed to one day become a developer; they had all the secrets.

## Hobbies


I love going to art exhibitions, one of the most things I saw was an VR exhibition by Marshmellow Laser Feast called _We Live in an Ocean of Air_. I had never seen art and technology combined like that it sparked a huge interest in VR and AR.


I like taking photos but I forgot how much I loved painting - wanting to have a break from coding meant that I bought a sketch pad and paints again after years of not touching either.


I got very into cycling; I cycled from Milan to Barcelona in two weeks, staying in eco-communities and camping.

I work as a supervisor behind the bar at the music venue, _The Green Note_, once a week. This hodge-podge-living-room of a music venue is one of Time Out's favourites, and some really whacky, wonderful bands play there.
