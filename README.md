# F R A N C E S C A  C H A T E R  

I am a Junior Developer looking for my first job to learn all sorts of exciting new things. The funnest lesson I have taken from Makers Academy is if I can learn one thing, I can learn another.

The most amazing and surprising discovery I have experienced through tech is reconnecting to all my old loves. When I told my mum I wanted to learn how to programme, she replied, "Well that makes complete sense considering how much you loved computer games."

I forgot how much I loved RTS games (Age of Empires II, Dungeon Keeper, Tropico); it was deeply satifying to build something up methodically and see that creation in action.

I have always loved cartoons and animations and I can't wait to build my first AR app as a fun side project. 

I forgot how much I loved painting - wanting to have a break from coding meant that I bought a sketch pad and paints again. 

 It's odd that doing something supposedly "serious" has made me think more creatively and energetically than I have since I was in primary school. I guess it's because I haven't felt this child-like excitement about something in a long time. 

Below are my favourite projects from my time at Makers.

For the final project, our team built a plant health monitoring system. We used all new software and we had never used any of the hardware before. 
Building something with code that took live readings from a real, living thing was such an incredible feeling. I loved combining code with something that is quintessentially the complete opposite of technology.

We documented any particularly exciting moments in our shared team [blog](https://medium.com/@makers_c_a_c_t_u_s). For example, we had never tested hardware before. If something doesn't work how you thought it would - a light doesn't turn on or the touch screen stops working after you merge everything - how do you fix that? After quickly suppressing mild panic, we were able to fix these issues in the same way we would fix bugs in our code. We eradicated possibilities by confirming parts we knew were working and got visibility in our code to ensure all our code was being reached. For more details, [here](https://medium.com/@makers_c_a_c_t_u_s/how-do-you-tdd-hardware-25f62da9aa) is how we discovered why our light wasn't turning on. As our first hardware bug, it was very exciting when we located the problem.

Finally, an app for aliens to communicate with their friends.*

We deployed Spacebook automatically to Heroku with Travis CI. Setting it up was one of the most challenging parts of the project; all our tests were passing on Travis but the build wasn't deploying. As we were so new to both systems we weren't sure why the connection broke down. But you'll be relieved to know we fixed it. It was such a relief I felt compelled to [write about it](https://medium.com/@spacebook3000/fixing-heroku-by-francesca-b1d2e5a9e1ec). <br>

#### I N D E P E N D A N T    L E A R N I N G 
Having had no previous coding experience, I taught myself Ruby to be accepted into Maker's Academy, a notoriously selective course with a 10% acceptance rate. 


#### Communication

- Pair-programming

# E D U C A T I O N

#### Makers Academy (April '19 to July '19)

- Building new things every week.
- Fast, independent learner. Learnt 
- Great collaborator [PROVIDE EVIDENCE]

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP. During my first engineering project I worked in a team of 6 to create a website called Spacebook. To ensure an agile working environment we met as a team three times a day for check-ins, documenting what we had acheived and what we were going to do for the next section of the day. We estimated how long each task would take and created two-day sprints to accomdate this. 
- I am language agnostic. Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine


- Pair programming (Driver / Navigator)
- Test Driven Development with RSpec

*Human Rights MA (Merit)*

<details><summary>Best thing I took from it?</summary>
<p> 

I based my dissertation on women in prisons in the UK. I interviewed prison staff across the board, including male and female officers, a counsellor from the sexual offenders ward, a nurse and the prison warden. The research was engrossing and that whole experience was  the most rewarding I had at university. After doing this I have known that I want to volunteer as a teacher in prisons in the future, either teaching creative writing or an introduction to programming.

<details><summary>Best thing I took from it?</summary>
<p> 
I learnt the invaluable lesson of how not to write. I loved reading novels and studying emotive (and some not so emotive) pieces of art. The only trouble was I was also reading a lot of critical art and literature essays, which meant I started imitating them in my own writing. It was not effective. What point was I trying to make? Who knows, you've fallen down my Alice in Wonderland tunnel of a sentence. You want the readers on your side. You also want to know exactly what you're talking about. Sure, obvious now, but it takes a couple of years of waffle to fully comprehend how little sense youâ€™re making.

* I like art, I go to an exhibtion on Sunday afternoons because it takes you to a different part of your brain and you remember how much other stuff there is out there. One of the most amazing exhibitions I went to was Marshmellow Laser Feast - Air. I had never seen art and technology combined like that.
* I like to take photos and paint things, they're just colourful blobs at the moment.
* Big fan of cycling, I cycled from Milan to Barcelona two years ago, staying at eco-villages and camping. 
* I'm lucky to have a geographically-dispersed family: a grandmother in Mexico and cousins who I'm very close with in Paris and New York. We're similar ages so as we grew up I visited them in Atlanta when we were in high school and New Orleans when we were in college. I'm going to South Africa with them in August so I'm reading lots of books by South African authors.
* Now I can definitely add to my list building fun side projects. I've got an arduino board and some programmable lights. I am also getting to grips with Unity and C++ for a VR and AR project.
