# Francesca Chater

I am a software engineer with a background in marketing and PR. During my previous role, I got to play around with some code by chance and was immediately drawn in by the challenge of the logic. The more I practised, I saw how creative writing code could be and I was hooked. So I took the plunge, quit everything, and retrained in software development at Makers Academy, a highly selective coding Bootcamp.

During my time at Makers, and since, I have hugely enjoyed problem-solving as it has made me more creative than I can remember. Instead of believing something can’t be done, it’s hugely fun to find what can be done and incorporate those solutions to a project.   

## Projects


**Personal Projects**<br>
After graduating, I was keen to use Unity and C# to build an AR app. I made a Fireworks simulation in Unity to see how C# interacted with 3D objects and an AR palm tree app in Vuforia.

I am currently working through the online Tyler McGinnis course to “master the JavaScript Ecosystem”.

For the final project at Makers, our team built a plant health monitoring system in ten days. We used new software and hardware, taking readings from the moisture in the soil via a sensor, and showcasing the data on a real-time graph on a touchscreen attached to a raspberry pi.

Finally, an app for aliens to communicate with their friends.

We deployed Spacebook automatically to Heroku with Travis CI. Setting it up was one of the most challenging parts of the project; all our tests were passing on Travis but the build wasn't deploying. I discovered that there are two different Travis platforms, travis.com and travis.org. As there are two, it matters how you create an encrypted authentication token which was causing the issue.


## Education

**Makers Academy (April '19 to July '19)** <br>
[Personal Blog](https://medium.com/@fetc)


Testing
- Behaviour and Test Driven Development in RSpec, Jasmin and Cabybara. 
- High test code coverage ( > 95%) and code maintainability.
- Continuous Integration: Travis CI to Heroku.


Process
- Algorithm Design and Object Orientated Programming 
- Clean code (DRY) using the Single Responsibility Principle and linters. 
- Learning a new language fast: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python and Javascript. Front-end styling with CSS and HTML5.
- Databases: PostgreSQL, Datamapper, ActiveRecord. See less

Teamwork <br>
Working as a team using agile methodologies:
 - Pair programming and mobbing.
 - Regular stand-ups and retros for group projects. 
 - Project collaboration on Github. 

#### University of Sussex (Sep '10 to May '14)


Human Rights MA *(Merit)*

I based my dissertation on women in prisons in the UK. I interviewed prison staff across the board, including male and female officers, a counsellor from the sexual offenders ward, a nurse and the prison warden. The research was engrossing and the experience was the most rewarding I had at university. Because of this, one day I would like to volunteer as a teacher in prisons, teaching either creative writing or computer programming. 
 
English Literature and Art History BA *(2:1)*

During my BA, I learnt the invaluable lesson of how not to write. I loved reading novels and studying emotive (and some not so emotive) pieces of art, at the same time I was reading a lot of critical essays on literature and art – and unfortunately I started imitating those essays in my own writing. It was not effective. What point was I trying to make? Who knows, you've fallen down my Alice-in-Wonderland-tunnel of a sentence. You want the readers on your side. You also want to know exactly what you're talking about. Sure, obvious now, but it takes a couple of years of waffle to fully appreciate how little sense you’re making. 

## Experience

**Sport Heroes Group** (May '17 to December '18)    
*UK Content and Community Lead*

I managed the UK community of 100,000 members for a tech start-up. This included researching and writing the weekly newsletter, building Facebook ads and campaign reports from Google Analytics, outsourcing and leading the content team and managing the campaigns from start to finish for major sports brands. 

<br> 

This offered a much larger range of technologies than my previous role and I was energised by the challenge of learning how to use the different software. After having the chance to play around with an HTML template in Dreamweaver for the weekly newsletter, I realised how much I wanted to learn how to write code. It offered the logic and clarity that had attracted me to accounting during my previous role, while also incorporating a huge amount of creativity.

**tpr Media Consultants** (August '15 to April '17)   
*Account Manager*  

In a team of three, we built publicity campaigns for clients including the BBC and Channel 4, spanning across all media outlets. I quickly became interested in the accounts and migrated the excel sheet system over to an accounting software called FreeAgent. This consolidated all financial matters, including invoices, business expenses, cash receipts and from there I was able to calculate the tax that was owed. I cancelled unnecessary subscriptions and highlighted overcharges, saving the founder and CEO considerable money. As a direct result of this, I considered studying accountancy. I liked the clarity it offered and the potential to help people understand what was happening with their money.


**YPlan** (October '14 to June '15)   
*Content Producer*

This was my first expereince working with software developers. I wrote the content for the listed events of the fastest growing start-up at the time. Every week, there was a meeting with all the staff members about what could be done to improve the app and unbeknownst to me, my experience at YPlan planted the seed to one day become a developer.

## Hobbies


I love going to art exhibitions; the We Live in an Ocean of Air exhibition by Marshmellow Laser Feast sparked a huge interest in VR and AR. I have since played around with Unity and attended VR and 3D Design meetups as a result.


I got very into cycling; I cycled from Milan to Barcelona in two weeks, staying in eco-communities and camping.

I work as a supervisor behind the bar at the music venue, The Green Note, once a week. This hodge-podge-living-room of a music venue is one of Time Out's favourites, and some really wacky, wonderful bands play there.
