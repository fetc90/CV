# Francesca Chater

I have just graduated from _Makers_, London's top software development programme, and I am looking for a role where I can continue to train as a full-stack developer.



## Projects


**Personal Projects**<br>
Since graduating, I have been keen to use Unity and C# to build an AR app. 
I started with a Fireworks simulation and have made an AR palm tree app.

For the final project at Makers, our team built a plant health monitoring system in ten days. We used new software and hardware which we picked up during the two-week time frame. 
Building something with code that took live readings from a real, living thing was a great way to end the course. We experimented with different MVPs:

We documented any particularly exciting moments in our shared [team blog](https://medium.com/@makers_c_a_c_t_u_s). For example, we had never tested hardware before. If something doesn't work how you thought it would - a light doesn't turn on or the touch screen stops working after you merge everything - how do you fix that? After quickly suppressing mild panic, we were able to fix these issues in the same way we would fix bugs in our code. We eradicated possibilities by confirming parts we knew were working and got visibility in our code to ensure all our code was being reached. We were then able to spot that we had referenced the wrong pin number of the raspberry pi in our code. As this was our first hardware bug, it was very exciting when we located the problem.<br>

Finally, an app for aliens to communicate with their friends.* This project was the first time we got to play around and experiment with the appearance of an app.

We deployed Spacebook automatically to Heroku with Travis CI. Setting it up was one of the most challenging parts of the project; all our tests were passing on Travis but the build wasn't deploying. I discovered that there are two different Travis platforms, travis.com and travis.org. As there are two, it matters how you create an encrypted authentication token which was causing the issue.

#### University of Sussex (Sep '10 to May '14)


Human Rights MA *(Merit)*

I based my dissertation on women in prisons in the UK. I interviewed prison staff across the board, including male and female officers, a counsellor from the sexual offenders ward, a nurse and the prison warden. The research was engrossing and the experience was the most rewarding I had at university. Because of this, one day I would like to volunteer as a teacher in prisons, teaching either creative writing or computer programming. 
 
English Literature and Art History BA *(2:1)*

During my BA, I learnt the invaluable lesson of how not to write. I loved reading novels and studying emotive (and some not so emotive) pieces of art, at the same time I was reading a lot of critical essays on literature and art – and unfortunately I started imitating those essays in my own writing. It was not effective. What point was I trying to make? Who knows, you've fallen down my Alice-in-Wonderland-tunnel of a sentence. You want the readers on your side. You also want to know exactly what you're talking about. Sure, obvious now, but it takes a couple of years of waffle to fully comprehend how little sense you’re making. 



## Experience

I come from a PR and marketing background with experience in managing brand and publicity campaigns. There was lots of pitching to press, copywriting, photo editing, using CRM databases, building Facebook ads and writing reports from Google Analytics. 

My favourite part of my previous job was writing the weekly newsletter about running which was sent out to an audience of 100,000. I greatly enjoyed the challenge of trying to find quirky or original stories about running - or if I couldn't find any - write about them in a way that I found amusing.

- Building brand communication campaigns with a reach of over 1.6 million for major sports brands including Nike, adidas, Polar, Salomon and leading lifestyle brands including Bose and Ted Baker; charities include UNICEF.
- Writing campaign reports outlining the communication strategy, metrics and evaluation. Data gathered from Google Analytics, social media analytics, Intercom and Mailjet.
- Working with the business development team to build new and maintain current relationships with clients, to then go on to lead their communication campaigns.
- Coordinating content production; outsourcing and managing a team of five content writers and deciding on topics of discussion. Reader engagement tripled from February to June 2018 and has remained consistent at 3,000 readers.
- Researching topics of that week to create the weekly newsletters, ranging from news in the running world, science, lifestyle or nutrition, reaching an audience of 100,000 with a 20% open rate.  
- Managing the social media accounts for Running Heroes and Cycling Heroes, across Facebook (26,000+ followers), Twitter (3500+ followers) and Instagram (1300+ followers).
- Hosting monthly social community runs of 50 people. The UK team had a record turn-out compared to French and Australian Sport Heroes teams, who both had a turn-out of 20.

**tpr Media Consultants** (August '15 to April '17)   
*Account Manager*  

A PR company that promoted mainly documentaries, e.g. *The Killing Fields of Sri Lanka* or *Last Whites of the East End* (we tended to promote things with a social angle), but then expanded to help promote causes, such as *Justice for Health*: the Junior Doctors who took Jeremy Hunt to court proteseting unsafe working contracts. 

I pitched to press across all the boards - newspaper, radio, television - and helped write press campaigns from start to finish.

I also quickly became the token 'IT guy' of the office.

**YPlan** (October '14 to June '15)   
*Content Producer*

This was my first expereince working with software developers. My role was to write content and edit images that would engage the users. Every week, there was a meeting with all the staff members about what could be done to improve the app and I could listen to the developers talk about what they had acheived. Unbeknownst to me, my experience at YPlan planted the seed to one day become a developer; they had all the secrets.

## Hobbies


I love going to art exhibitions, one of the most things I saw was an VR exhibition by Marshmellow Laser Feast called _We Live in an Ocean of Air_. I had never seen art and technology combined like that it sparked a huge interest in VR and AR.


I like taking photos but I forgot how much I loved painting - wanting to have a break from coding meant that I bought a sketch pad and paints again after years of not touching either.


I got very into cycling; I cycled from Milan to Barcelona in two weeks, staying in eco-communities and camping.

I work as a supervisor behind the bar at the music venue, _The Green Note_, once a week. This hodge-podge-living-room of a music venue is one of Time Out's favourites, and some really whacky, wonderful bands play there.
